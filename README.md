NIFTi_InFieldPicsServer
=======================

 The In-Field Pictures Server is a central hub to exchange pictures between different actors connected to a ROS network. First, the server reads camera images from a ROS topic, analyzes them, and saves them locally. Additionally, anyone can move pictures into this folder and the server will also analyze them. EXIF information is extracted and meta-data is stored. All of the analyzed pictures are broadcast within a few seconds with attached meta-data. Anyone listening to that ROS topic receives the pictures and their later modifications, if any.  In NIFTi, we used this software to share pictures of the explored environments between various actors of a search and rescue team, such as mission commanders, robot pilots, and in-field rescuers. The Operator Control Units (OCUs) that the pilots used had a button to take snapshots of camera feeds that were sent to the server, analyzed, and broadcast as a picture localized picture within the ROS map. All pictures could be accessed from these OCUs. Additionally, synchronized the server's folder with a Dropbox account for the team. In-field rescuers also synchronized their cameras with the same Dropbox account so that their pictures would be transferred to the team as soon as they were taken. This is only one usage scenario but the server is not restricted to it.
